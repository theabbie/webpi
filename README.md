WebPi bridges Pi's real interactive terminal UI to a full-screen Streamlit app.
It does not recreate or imitate the TUI: every keypress and ANSI frame travels
between xterm.js and an actual Pi process running inside a Linux PTY.

## What it feels like

You get the familiar Pi experience in a browser tab: startup resources, slash
commands, keyboard shortcuts, streaming output, tool calls, scrollback, colors,
cursor movement, and responsive terminal resizing.

## Highlights

- **The real Pi TUI** — connected through a native pseudo-terminal, not parsed
  or redrawn as HTML.
- **Zero model setup** — the bundled `exa-direct` extension defaults to
  `google/gemini-2.5-flash` through Exa's public demo endpoint.
- **Full-screen xterm.js** — responsive sizing, 10,000 lines of scrollback,
  true-color ANSI output, clickable links, paste, arrows, Escape, and Ctrl-key
  handling.
- **Fresh workspace per connection** — every terminal starts in a private
  `0700` directory under `/tmp/webpi-workspaces`.
- **Fresh session storage** — Pi transcripts stay inside that connection's
  temporary workspace.
- **Instant static publishing** — files written to `public/` are served at the
  session-specific URL in `$WEBPI_PUBLIC_URL`, with no localhost server needed.
- **Scoped localhost servers** — each terminal receives one assigned port and
  a public `$WEBPI_PROXY_URL` for Node, Python, and other HTTP applications.
- **Reproducible runtime** — Streamlit bootstraps Node `22.19.0`, Pi `0.80.6`,
  rclone `1.74.3`, `ripgrep`, and `fd-find` when the app environment is created.
- **Normal interactive startup** — Pi displays its standard header, loaded
  global context, model, and extensions.

## Architecture

```text
Browser
  └─ xterm.js
       └─ secure same-origin WebSocket
            └─ Streamlit's Tornado server
                 └─ Linux PTY
                      └─ Pi CLI
                           ├─ Exa Direct provider
                           ├─ isolated temporary workspace
                           ├─ public/ static file route
                           └─ read / bash / edit / write tools
```

The WebSocket uses Streamlit Cloud's own `~/+/` proxy path, so the terminal
works over `wss://` without exposing a second port or running a separate public
terminal server.

## Deploy on Streamlit Community Cloud

Fork this repository, create a new Streamlit app, and select:

```text
Repository: <your-account>/webpi
Branch: main
Main file: streamlit_app.py
```

No Streamlit secrets are required for the bundled Exa provider. On first boot,
dependency preparation can take a little longer while Node and Pi are installed
under `/tmp`. Later terminal connections reuse that runtime for the life of the
app instance.

## Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theabbie/webpi.git
cd webpi
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:8501`.

## Pi configuration

WebPi creates a clean global agent directory at `/tmp/webpi-agent` containing:

```text
/tmp/webpi-agent/
├── AGENTS.md
├── settings.json
├── bin/
│   └── fd → fdfind
└── extensions/
    └── exa-direct.ts
```

The configuration follows Pi's documented interactive defaults:

- Standard startup header enabled.
- Dark theme.
- Automatic compaction and transient-error retries.
- Install telemetry and analytics disabled.
- Project-local executable resources are not trusted automatically.
- A global `AGENTS.md` defines hosted-workspace conventions.

See the official [Pi documentation](https://pi.dev/docs/latest) for commands,
keybindings, extensions, skills, sessions, and configuration.

## Publish HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Each terminal begins with a `public/` folder and two environment variables:

```bash
echo "$WEBPI_PUBLIC_DIR"
echo "$WEBPI_PUBLIC_URL"
```

Write static files there and open the URL Pi reports:

```bash
cat > public/index.html <<'HTML'
<!doctype html>
<h1>Hello from WebPi</h1>
HTML

echo "$WEBPI_PUBLIC_URL"
```

Paths map directly: `public/assets/app.css` is available at
`$WEBPI_PUBLIC_URL/assets/app.css`. Use relative asset URLs because every
terminal receives a unique, unguessable URL prefix. Hosting remains active only
while that terminal's WebSocket is connected.

## Run a Node server

Each session receives a dedicated loopback address and public proxy URL:

```bash
echo "$WEBPI_HOST:$WEBPI_PORT"
echo "$WEBPI_PROXY_URL"
```

A minimal Node server can use the standard `PORT` variable:

```js
// server.js
const http = require("node:http");

const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.setHeader("content-type", "application/json");
  response.end(JSON.stringify({ ok: true, path: request.url }));
});

server.listen(Number(process.env.PORT), process.env.WEBPI_HOST);
```

Start it in the background and open the reported URL:

```bash
nohup node server.js > .webpi-server.log 2>&1 &
echo "$WEBPI_PROXY_URL"
```

The public URL forwards GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, request bodies,
query strings, responses, and redirects to that session's assigned localhost
port. Use relative browser asset paths because the URL contains a session
prefix. Session tokens contain only lowercase letters and digits. WebSocket
upgrades and hot-module reload are not currently supported.
The server and URL stop when the terminal disconnects or the app restarts.

## Proton Drive experiments

WebPi includes a checksum-verified rclone binary with Proton Drive support and
prepares private per-session locations:

```bash
echo "$RCLONE_CONFIG"
echo "$RCLONE_MOUNT_DIR"
echo "$RCLONE_CACHE_DIR"
echo "$RCLONE_LOG_DIR"
```

Pi's `!` commands are non-interactive, so create the remote without the rclone
menu. First obscure the password on a trusted local machine:

```bash
read -s -p 'Proton password: ' PROTON_PASSWORD; printf '\n'
rclone obscure "$PROTON_PASSWORD"
unset PROTON_PASSWORD
```

Copy the resulting obscured value, then run this in WebPi with your values:

```bash
!rclone config create proton protondrive username 'YOUR_PROTON_USERNAME' password 'OBSCURED_PASSWORD'
!rclone lsd proton:
```

The obscured value is reversible and must still be treated as a credential.
Then try mounting the configured remote:

```bash
rclone mount proton: "$RCLONE_MOUNT_DIR" \
  --vfs-cache-mode writes \
  --cache-dir "$RCLONE_CACHE_DIR" \
  --log-file "$RCLONE_LOG_DIR/mount.log" \
  --daemon
```

Community Cloud may deny FUSE mounts. If that happens, use `rclone copy`
instead. Configuration and files are ephemeral and disappear with the session;
never print or publish the rclone config because its obscured password is
reversible.

## Keyboard essentials

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| `Enter` | Send a prompt |
| `Shift+Enter` | Insert a new line |
| `Escape` | Interrupt the current operation |
| `Ctrl+C` / `Ctrl+D` | Clear or exit |
| `Ctrl+O` | Toggle expanded startup/tool output |
| `/` | Browse Pi commands |
| `!command` | Run a shell command |
| `@file` | Reference a workspace file |

## Security model

WebPi gives each connection a separate working directory and session directory,
but it is **not an OS-level sandbox**. Pi runs with the permissions of the
Streamlit app process and its `bash` tool can navigate outside the workspace.

Do not expose a deployment containing valuable secrets or credentials to
untrusted users. A destructive command can damage the current app instance,
though a Streamlit Cloud reboot normally reconstructs it from the repository.
Separate Streamlit apps run in separate environments.

For stronger isolation, place the Pi process inside a real container, VM, or
restricted operating-system sandbox.
